# Example

Some *getting-started* examples.

## Simple

A simple use case with an editor in the center and a menu bar on the left side.
This example is such simple that it doesn't use redux or flux either.

Try the live demo [here](https://lochbrunner.github.io/react-flow-editor/simple/).

## Redux

Coming soon.
